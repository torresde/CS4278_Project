## Interview
	1.	Why would you use a text to find out what time club meetings are?
	  ⁃	There’s nowhere I could go to check when the times for club meetings. It would be nice to have somewhere besides email to check when my club meetings are.
	  ⁃	I would like the ease and fluidity that this text messaging app offers.
	  ⁃	I think that it would be quicker than opening a mail app and signing in and looking through emails for my meeting times.
	2.	Would you want to receive times for all of your clubs or just one?
	  ⁃	I would just want one club so I can find the time of a club I care about. If I was in a lot of clubs it would be too much info.
	  ⁃	Just one if I could specify which club.
	  ⁃	Just one meeting time from a club that I can select otherwise I might get too much information back.
	3.	When would you use an application that lists club meeting times?
	  ⁃	When I’m not sure when my club is meeting and I’m busy with other things and I want a response back immediately about my club time.
	  ⁃	When I’m in need of club meeting times perhaps an hour or two before club meeting times.
	  ⁃	I would use it when I’m on my phone and away from my computer or I need to find a specific meeting time fast.
	4.	Is there an application that already has club meeting times listed?
	  ⁃	Not that I can think of except Anchorlink but nobody really uses it.
	  ⁃	I do not believe so.
	  ⁃	I think the only way to get meeting times is through emails but I get a lot of emails daily so sometimes the info I want is tricky    to find.
	5.	What other information would you like to receive?
	  ⁃	Location of the meeting would be useful.
	  ⁃	Location. If food will be present.
	  ⁃	Maybe the location but if I really wanted other information I could just go to the email.
	6.	Would you like it to give future meeting times past the next meeting?
	  ⁃	Yes
	  ⁃	No
	  ⁃	Just one meeting time for a quick text otherwise I might get too much information back.
	7.	How many future meeting times would you like the response to show if it did?
	  ⁃	Maybe the next meeting could also be useful so I can plan ahead.
	  ⁃	Only one week in advance.
	  ⁃	Limit it to two or three maximum if I had to have this feature.
	8.	Would you want a message every time a meeting is added?
	  ⁃	A notification would be nice.
	  ⁃	Yes that would desirable because I like to be well informed.
	  ⁃	I already get an email notification when meetings are originally published so I don’t think it’s necessary but it could be a decent feature.
	9.	Would you want to make recurring meeting times as club leader?
	  ⁃	Yeah that would be pretty useful if I had a meeting every Monday or so. I wouldn’t want to send a text every week.
	  ⁃	Yes that would be ideal because I believe it will streamline communication with my peers.
	  ⁃	Only if adding a meeting is difficult because otherwise I could just add meetings quickly as needed.
	10.	Would you want to delete meetings as club leader?
	  ⁃	Yes I should be able to remove meeting times as well and I might want it to send a notification so the members know it’s removed.
	  ⁃	Yes if the meeting was made by accident or if it was rescheduled.
	  ⁃	Yeah because sometimes meetings get cancelled in real life.


## Requirements
* Register your club so other members can subscribe to it
* Add meetings for your club
* Send a text to registered club members
* Register to a club to receive messages
* Request the meeting times for a specific club and receive the times

## Stretch Goal
Add the ability for a club leader mode and a club member mode.
Add the ability to automatically send an update to registered members when a meeting time is added.

## Development Approach
The process will be to use an Agile workflow to meet with the prospective users hopefully twice to ensure that I am building an app that addresses the pain points of the users.

At the first meeting with prospective users I want to have completed the Minimum Viable Product of being able to request the meeting information for a specific club as a club member and for adding and removing club meetings as the club leader. The application should be ready for this demo by mid to late week next week.

For the second meeting I will have completed all of the requirements listed above for this application. The application should be at this stage in about a week and a half. The requirements may change depending on feedback from the users, which will ensure that I avoid building functionality that does not add value to the users. The Agile work process is effective because meeting with the users ensures that the engineers' goals are aligned with the users' desires.
