	1.	Why would you use a text to find out what time club meetings are?
	  ⁃	There’s nowhere I could go to check when the times for club meetings. It would be nice to have somewhere besides email to check when my club meetings are.
	  ⁃	I would like the ease and fluidity that this text messaging app offers.
	  ⁃	I think that it would be quicker than opening a mail app and signing in and looking through emails for my meeting times.
	2.	Would you want to receive times for all of your clubs or just one?
	  ⁃	I would just want one club so I can find the time of a club I care about. If I was in a lot of clubs it would be too much info.
	  ⁃	Just one if I could specify which club.
	  ⁃	Just one meeting time from a club that I can select otherwise I might get too much information back.
	3.	When would you use an application that lists club meeting times?
	  ⁃	When I’m not sure when my club is meeting and I’m busy with other things and I want a response back immediately about my club time.
	  ⁃	When I’m in need of club meeting times perhaps an hour or two before club meeting times.
	  ⁃	I would use it when I’m on my phone and away from my computer or I need to find a specific meeting time fast.
	4.	Is there an application that already has club meeting times listed?
	  ⁃	Not that I can think of except Anchorlink but nobody really uses it.
	  ⁃	I do not believe so.
	  ⁃	I think the only way to get meeting times is through emails but I get a lot of emails daily so sometimes the info I want is tricky    to find.
	5.	What other information would you like to receive?
	  ⁃	Location of the meeting would be useful.
	  ⁃	Location. If food will be present.
	  ⁃	Maybe the location but if I really wanted other information I could just go to the email.
	6.	Would you like it to give future meeting times past the next meeting?
	  ⁃	Yes
	  ⁃	No
	  ⁃	Just one meeting time for a quick text otherwise I might get too much information back.
	7.	How many future meeting times would you like the response to show if it did?
	  ⁃	Maybe the next meeting could also be useful so I can plan ahead.
	  ⁃	Only one week in advance.
	  ⁃	Limit it to two or three maximum if I had to have this feature.
	8.	Would you want a message every time a meeting is added?
	  ⁃	A notification would be nice.
	  ⁃	Yes that would desirable because I like to be well informed.
	  ⁃	I already get an email notification when meetings are originally published so I don’t think it’s necessary but it could be a decent feature.
	9.	Would you want to make recurring meeting times as club leader?
	  ⁃	Yeah that would be pretty useful if I had a meeting every Monday or so. I wouldn’t want to send a text every week.
	  ⁃	Yes that would be ideal because I believe it will streamline communication with my peers.
	  ⁃	Only if adding a meeting is difficult because otherwise I could just add meetings quickly as needed.
	10.	Would you want to delete meetings as club leader?
	  ⁃	Yes I should be able to remove meeting times as well and I might want it to send a notification so the members know it’s removed.
	  ⁃	Yes if the meeting was made by accident or if it was rescheduled.
	  ⁃	Yeah because sometimes meetings get cancelled in real life.
